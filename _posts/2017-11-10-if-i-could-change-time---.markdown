Classical music has the power to immerse the listener to another era and sensibility or to plunge it into an almost unbearable modernity.&nbsp;<br>What would be your choice?&nbsp;<br>The spirituality and metaphysical music by Bach, or the refined and illuministic eighteenth-century world, the one with the music by Haydn and Mozart, or the early nineteenth century, with the first heroic composers like Beethoven, or the full romanticism of Liszt, Brahms and Wagner or the strained and contorted 20th century music? Or even our eclectical and borderless contemporary music?
