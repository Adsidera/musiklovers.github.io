We live in a digital era, where all borders are now eased out by a global communication network.

But still, this is an era of an excruciating renaissance of...borders-fanatics, wall-fanatics...

Well: if there is an art that does not have borders, not even those limiting of words, that's music. And we think that we all agree upon that.

But we want to go further deep, we want to analyse.

To what culture does the offered music by Konzerthaus belong to?&nbsp;

Can we assert that is is Eurocentric, Germanocentric, Slavocentric, Scandinaviancentric or..?&nbsp;
