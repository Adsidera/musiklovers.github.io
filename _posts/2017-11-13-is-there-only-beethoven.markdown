More than 4500 events, between exhibitions and concerts happened at Konzerthaus Berlin in these last 10 years.

Think about it: what are 10 years?

A lot of time, that you can easily associate with a lot of personal and social changes. A newborn baby in ten years is already a grown kid that can speak, write, read, study, even play an instrument.

But for classical music? 10 years in comparison to the centuries-old &nbsp;classical music are instead just like a drop of water in an ocean.&nbsp;

Still, is there a preferred, top-performed composer in all these ten years?&nbsp;

A classic of all classics?
