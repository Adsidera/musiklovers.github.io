So many years have passed since the first season we are taking into account, 2008/2009.<br>More than 4500 events, between exhibitions and concerts happened at Konzerthaus Berlin in these last 10 years.&nbsp;

Think about it: what are 10 years? A lot of time, that you can easily associate with a lot of personal and social changes. A newborn baby in ten years is already a grown kid that can speak, write, read, study, even play an instrument.
